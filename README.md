# covid19-wechat-app
A WeChat app showing the latest daily new covid19 cases for each Australia state  
  
WeChat mini programs are the mobile apps running on WeChat. It is a MVVM framework similar to Vue, but provides more capabilities like authentication, social network, payment and location etc.  
  
You need to download Weixin DevTools to edit and compile this project. It won't run properly as the backend web api is replaced with a fake URL 'https://demo.com/api/'. This is because the web app I developed is runnin on an Alibaba cloud server I rented myself. The source code of the backend web app is in the repository named as weather-web-app  

The comments in source code are in Chinese since most of the WeChat developers are Chinese.
